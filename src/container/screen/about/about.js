              times in your life, and you even might've thought "Maybe I can
              donate blood too and that way, I'll save a life". At the same
              time, someone in a hospital within your walking distance is in
              urgent need of blood with your blood group the hospital forgot to
              restock that particular blood group. You can save that patient's
              life, but you don't know that the patient exists or is in need of
              blood. The hospital could've restocked the blood, but they didn't
              know they were out of stock. Clearly, there's a gap. We intend to
              bridge that with{" "}

              can easily view and manage their inventory, blood banks can sell
              blood to other users and any user can nake a request to all the
              active donors who are willing to donate their blood to save a
              life.
